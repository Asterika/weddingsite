# weddingsite
An SPA wedding site template

## Project Concept
This single page web app, currently living at [here at GitHub Pages](https://asterika.github.io/weddingsite/), is designed to provide future wedding guests an preview of events and a chance to RSVP.

Currently, images are being used as placeholders for the couple's story, details about the venue, a photo gallery, registry options, and a guestbook/RSVP form until design specs are finalized.

## Technologies and Assets
Technologies used in this project include HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. All images currently featured are courtesy [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), and the logo was created with [DesignWizard](https://www.designwizard.com/).

## Technologies Implemented
This app was created with Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS and was developed using GitHub Pages and Atom. All site images are included courtesty Unsplash and the logo was designed with Canva.

## Technical Challenges
* Note: As we are currently in the midst of migrating from Bootstrap v.3 to v.4, after deliberating for a while, I opted for a pure CSS navbar.

* Logo Placement - During testing, the logo appeared in various places on the screen. I chose to address this issue with a few media queries. 

## Future Optimizations
After consulting further with the couple, I intend to replace most of the stock images with personal images and content fitting for their sections, including an RSVP/Guestbook form, venue details, and links to registry/ies.
